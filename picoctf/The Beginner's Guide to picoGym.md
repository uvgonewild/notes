# The Beginner's Guide to picoGym 

I've Finally Completed The Beginner's guide to picoGym, and interestingly it was worth it, learned a thing or two about reverse engineering and some other tools and concepts.
 - Successfully reverse engineered a Python Program & a C program through some debugging
 - Got to know that `grep` can be used recursively through `r` tag...

Though Easy, it was engaging and fun to learn!
